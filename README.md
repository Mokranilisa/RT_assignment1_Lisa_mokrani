# ROS Turtle Simulation Project

This project demonstrates basic control and monitoring of multiple turtles in the ROS (Robot Operating System) environment using the `turtlesim` package. The system includes two primary functionalities:
- **Spawning and controlling turtles** via velocity commands.
- **Monitoring the distance** between two turtles and ensuring they stay within a predefined boundary.
